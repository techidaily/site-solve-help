There are a number of apps that are available to read books on iPad, free or charged, allow us to buy, download and view ebooks for iPad. But as both an iPad user and an ebook fan, sometimes we may feel confused about which app to use is better, is there an app that allows us to read books purchased everywhere, no matter drm protected or drm free, and so on.

Today in this guide I gather some best apps to read ebook on iPad. You can follow this guide to find the app(s) you need. And, in order to meet your needs, I also spend some time talking about their features, my own opinions, give you some good suggestions to help you find the best way to read books on iPad.

### iBooks for iPad--by Apple

![ibooks](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ibooks.jpg) iBooks for iPad is the built-in reading app for IOS devices. It's Apple's ebook store. The best thing about iBooks is that you can purchase books in this store directly, while another third-party reading apps require you to go to their websites to buy, then back to their apps to read. So with iBooks after you find an interesting book, you can purchase it right away (with Apple ID), then download it to iPad to have a reading. It's the best app to buy books for iPad. Besides, iBooks also reads books in ePub and PDF format unprotected.

But if you often use iBooks you may not feel so satisfied with it, like me, because its catalog is not so bigger than other stores, like Kindle. So if you love reading different kinds of books, I'm sure iBooks will not meet your needs totally. You must have a demand of searching some another good apps.

**Price**: **Free** from [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193).

### Kindle app for iPad--by Amazon

![kindle for ipad](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-for-ipad.jpg) One of the best third-party reading apps for iPad, I think. The Kindle has an larger catalog, we can find some more books that we couldn't find in iBooks. Kindle is provided by Amazon, as eBooks we purchase from amazon store have kindle's own formats, such as azw3, mobi, so we have no choice but installing Kindle app on iPad to read kindle books. Except for books from kindle store, Kindle can also display PDF and Mobi files if they are DRM free. You can sync documents as well with Kindle email address.

But the shortcoming appears at this time. Once a book are purchased from amazon, we can only use Kindle app, no matter we like it or not.

**Price**: **Free** from [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8).

### Kobo app for iPad--by Rakuten

![kobo for ipad](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kobo-for-ipad.png) Another good third-party reading app on iPad. It's from rakuten store, designed to be more social. In kobo store there are nearly 1 million free books. The same as Kindle, we can't buy books in this app. We must purchase their files on the website, then log in the kobo app to sync books we've bought. Kobo also supports ePub books with or without drm, I love this point very much.

The bad point is the same as Kindle. Though Kobo app reads DRMed epub books, but we must make sure they are with the same Adobe ID as our kobo account email.

**Price**: **Free** from [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kobo-reading-app-read-books/id301259483?mt=8).

**Note:** Kobo app is also available for Sony users. For details please [visit this content](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/).

### Nook for iPad--by B&N

![nook for ipad](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/nook-on-ipad.jpg) Similarly, Nook app is also designed only for nook users. The best point I like nook app is that I can control page formatting. I can choose both default and customize the fonts, size, highlight colors, etc.

But we can still read books purchased only from Barnes and Noble store.

**Price**: **Free** from [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nook/id373582546?mt=8).

### Play Books for iPad--by Google

![play books for ipad](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/google-play-books-for-ipad.png) Google Play Books is another good portal to read books in Google Play Books library. It collects a lot of google books in this store, thus we can say it is designed for Google fans, or android fans. We can intall this app on android smart phone or tablet with easy, just with Google account. Now Apple allows us to install this app on IOS device for free, I like this service.

**Price**: **Free** from [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-play-books/id400989007?mt=8).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Bluefire Reader-best for Adobe books

![bluefire for ipad](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/bluefire-for-ipad.png) Bluefire Reader is a good [alternative for Adobe Digital Editions on iPad](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). It supports Adobe DRM books, connected with your Adobe ID, regardless of where they were from. For example, as we known that some of kobo and sony books are protected with Adobe DRM, so when reading kobo and sony books, if we don't want to install kobo, we can install bluefire instead. It replaces all apps with adobe drm books.

**Price**: **Free** from [Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bluefire-reader/id394275498?mt=8).

**Note:** TXTR is another good app for adobe contents. [Click here](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) to get more information please.

### eBookMobi--for multiple format books

![eBookMobi for iPad](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ebookmobi-for-ipad.png) eBookMobi is the most versatile reading app, I think. This is because eBookMobi supports nearly all formats, ePub, PDF, CBR, TXT, PDB, FB2, and even Kindle's Mobi format (this is great). With iTunes Filesharing we can import those files from our devices or computer to iPad with easy. So if you collect a lot of books with multiple formats, this app may become your best choice.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Price**: **$1.99** from [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ebookmobi/id413897025?mt=8)

But eBookMobi's shortcoming is that it can only read drm free ebooks, while you know that most books we purchased from sites are with drm problems. Don't worry here is a good tool to help you remove any drm with [DRM Removal](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/drm-removal-tools/) tool.

### The best app?

Have recommended so many apps, which one is the best?

Except for iBooks, another apps are third-party readers, they are related to their stores, and the formats and DRM kinds are also limited. Books we have purchased are not our own files, we just have the right to read. Want to read books on iPad freely? Here is my suggestion.

#### 1\. Buy and download books from stores.

No matter which store you like, go there to find your books, download them to your iPad or other devices or computer.

#### 2\. Convert books to iBooks

As iBooks is the built-in reading app, so the reading experience is guaranteed, be safe, be free.

But iBooks only reads files purchased from iBooks stores, so for those contents we purchased from other stores, we need to convert them to iBooks format. The tool needed [Ultimate Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), helps you remove any drm from books and convert them to epub or pdf format.

#### 3\. Transfer books to iPad, open with iBooks app

After you remove drm to let your files free, and convert them to iBooks format epub or pdf, from the output folder you can select them to transfer to iPad with iTunes.

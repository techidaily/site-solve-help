Have you ever thought this way that you have no time or very limited free personal time doing what you love to do because you live a busy life? Like acquiring knowledge by reading books or watching free open classes. And nowadays audiobook has become popular all over the world for its convenience and flexibility. You can listen to audiobook on your way to office or while driving or doing chores. So in this article I am going to tell you top 5 useful tips on getting started with audiobooks. 

### Why you should listen to audiobooks

#### 1\. Speed 

First and foremost, listening to audiobook is way much quicker. And you can acquire more information with less time. For example, an average 300 pages book usually takes a month to finish, however, you will only need 5 hours when the book is converted to audiobook. 

####  2\. Convenient 

Listening stuff is more convenient than reading it. For example, you can listen to audiobook while driving, but there's no way for you to read it. So listening to audiobook is very practical. 

#### 3\. Portable 

You can put hundreds of audiobooks on a device and listen to them any time you want. But with a physical book, it's not possible.

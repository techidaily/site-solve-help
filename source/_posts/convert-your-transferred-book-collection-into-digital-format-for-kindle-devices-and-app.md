![Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kt_logo.png)People can read Amazon Kindle books on Kindle eReaders, Kindle Fire tablets as well as other smart devices with Kindle apps installed. Generally, once a device is registered to an Amazon account, all Kindle books under that account will be synced automatically with Internet connected.

However, if we want to read non-Amazon books on Kindle or purchased Kindle books do not shown on the device due to a connection problem, we will have to transfer books from computer to Kindle manually. This guide will tell you how to transfer books to Kindle eReader, Kindle Fire (HD), Kindle for Android/iPad app from PC or Mac.

### Step 1\. Make Sure Your Personal Books Are MOBI Format (DRM-free)

Amazon Kindle devices do not support EPUB books, but supports MOBI (DRM-free) and PDF formats. I personally prefer MOBI to PDF because the former is more flexible and better for reading.

**Note: Beginning in late 2022, you'll no longer be able to send MOBI (.AZW, .MOBI) files to your Kindle library using Send to Kindle. This change won't affect any MOBI files already in your Kindle library. You can still read them with Kindle.**

But most of books we download from torrent sites are often EPUB files. If you want to transfer these books to Kindle for reading, the perfect solution is converting the EPUB books to Mobi.

And If you want to transfer eBooks purchased from Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Google Play Books to Kindle, things will be a little tough. These books are typically DRM-protected so we can't directly convert the formats. Instead, we have to strip the DRM protection at first. DRM-protected PDF books also have to be decrypted because Kindle only supports DRM-free PDF.

In a word, before transferring books to Kindle, we should comfirm 2 things: Books are DRM free; Books are Kindle Mobi format.

Here is the best eBook DRM Removal & eBook Converter - [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), that can help you fulfill the job.

### Step 2\. Transfer Books from Computer to Kindle eReader, Kindle Fire(HD) and Kindle Apps

Once the books are DRM-free MOBI or PDF, we can easily transfer them from PC/Mac to Kindle eReader, Kindle Fire (HD), Kindle for Android/iOS app with USB or wirelessly.

#### The General Steps to Transfer Books to Kindle

1 Connect your device to computer via USB.

2 Double click the drive to open it and view the folders.

3 Select the item you want to transfer (mobi or pdf).

4 Copy books to the folder (documents) under Kindle drive.

5Or you can also use the Send-to-Kindle email address.

For each case below, I mainly explain how to transfer MOBI eBooks to Kindle with USB, which also works on PDF docs. To transfer books to Kindle without a USB cable, you should first find out the device email address (mentioned in each case), then send your books to the given device/app address.

#### **1\. Transfer MOBI/PDF Books to Kindle eReader**

**1** Connect your Kindle e-ink device to computer with the USB cable. It will be recognized as a "Kindle" drive.

**2**Drag and drop the MOBI books to the "documents" folder under Kindle drive.

**3** Eject Kindle from computer. The sideloaded books will display under "Device" shelf.

#### **2\. Transfer MOBI/PDF Books to Kindle Fire Tablets**

Here I take the Kindle Fire for example.

**How to transfer MOBI or PDF books to Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD with USB**:

**1** Connect your Kindle Fire (HD) to computer with the USB cable and it will be recognized as a Kindle drive.

**2** Copy and paste your MOBI books to the "Books" folder under the Kindle Fire (HD) Drive.

#### **3\. Transfer MOBI/PDF Books to Kindle App for Android** app

**1** Connect your Android tablet or smartphone to PC.

**2** Go to the "Kindle" folder of your Android device storage. Copy and paste the MOBI books to that folder.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### **4\. Transfer MOBI/PDF Books to Kindle App for iOS**

There is no way to directly transfer MOBI books to Kindle app for iOS with iTunes. In this case, we can use Kindle email system to send personal MOBI books to the email address of Kindle for iPad app. PDF files can be transferred to iPad with iTunes (opened with Apple Books by default) or with Kindle for iOS email address (opened with Kindle app for iOS by default).

**Send-to-Kindle E-mail Address of Kindle app for iOS:** 

Tap the gear icon in the bottom right corner and select "Send-to-Kindle Email Address".

![Transfer books to Kindle iPad - send to Kindle email address](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kt_ipad_email.png)

#### 5\. Transfer **MOBI/PDF** books to Kindle wirelessly (without a USB cable)

As long as we know the email addresses of the Kindle devices or apps, we will be able to send DRM-free MOBI and PDF books to Kindle, Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire (HD), Kindle for Android / iPad app wirelessly.

Note: Beginning in late 2022, you'll no longer be able to send MOBI (.AZW, .MOBI) files to your Kindle library using Send to Kindle. So if you want to use send-to-kindle service, please convert your ebooks to drm-free epub format.

**1** **Add your own (sender) email address to Kindle Approved Personal Document E-mail List.**

Visit Manage Your Kindle to sign in, go to "Your Kindle Account" from the left side menu and select "Personal Document Settings". Pay attention to the "Approved Personal Document E-mail List" and select "Add a new approved e-mail address." Enter your e-mail address then click "Add Address."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**2** Compose an empty email (empty subject and empty body), attach your MOBI or PDF docs and input the Send-to-Kindle E-mail address to send.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Tap sync icon on the Kindle device or Kindle app. In minutes, you will find the sent MOBI and PDF docs under "All Items" and "Docs" category (Cloud). (This screenshot was taken on Nexus 7.)

![received books through "send to Kindle" email address](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kt_email_transfer.png)

Note:

When you transfer PDF books to Kindle from computer, you will find the books not shown under "Books" (on device) shelf or category. That's right. PDF books typically display under "Docs" (on device) shelf.

That's all. This guide is based on Windows OS, but it also works if you want to transfer books to Kindle from Mac. As long as the books are not protected and converted to Kindle supported formats (MOBI or PDF), we will be able to read eBooks from other sources without confining to Amazon.

Thanks so much for the wonderful advice and coloumn. I have so many gift cards for Indigo (Kobo) yet I own a Kindle paperwhite. This software has enabled me to use my gift cards to purchase books for free and then read them on my Kindle. The instructions are very clear. I've not had any glitches. Wonderful!!!

Worked like a dream. I can't believe how easy this was to transfer from Kobo to my Kindle Paperwhite.  
 I was leery of this and thought that like other help from internet sources, I'd get through a gazillion steps only to find that there were a gazillion more complicated ones and either have to give up in frustration or hit a road block and have to give up. Not with Epubor! Follow the steps and it will work. Epubor to my PC; Kobo to my PC; Kobo to Epubor; boom; convert to MOBI; bam; plug Kindle to PC; drag and drop Kobo MOBI formatted books to Kindle; bam what! Eject Kindle from PC; go to Library on PC and books (with cover art) are automatically popping up! Open books; No Prob! Read & enjoy! Thanks SO much! Novice completed on first try! BML/July 2017

This did not work for me, I tried both programs, Epupbor and Ultimate. I was able to convert my Kobo files to mobi, but then they would not transfer. There is not "on Device" tab on my Kindle Fire 7th Gen. Tried copying and pasting, transfering, etc. The books are NOT on my Kindle device.

Epubor had an issue with the last couple of pages of a PDF file I was trying to convert, but when I removed those pages it worked really well. However, as Tory mentioned above, on my Sony Xperia XZ2, I can't find a "Kindle" subdirectory anywhere on my device. Using Root access to Android and was able to locate the Kindle-App but nowhere can I find anything that even remotely looks like a repository/directory for the actual Kindle books. I'm pretty familiar with Linux but a complete newbee with Android, so maybe I'm looking in the wrong places.

Problem solved - at least for me. When my Kindle Paperwhite crashed, I decided to install the Kindle-App on my smartphone as a temporary solution. Then had a problem with the missing Kindle directory - i.e. no place to transfer files to. The solution turned out to be easy:  
 From my PC, I created the missing "Kindle" directory manually, directly under "Internal shared storage". Then copied my files to it. Worked!

 May take a minute after transferring files before the Kindle-app detects them.

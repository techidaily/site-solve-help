Known as "world's first social eReader" **Kobo Vox** is a multi-use tablet. It offers access to unlimited storage in the kobo cloud, where readers start conversations, share views and leave reviews by ‘liking’, 'disliking’ or commenting in real-time with others reading the same book. kobo claims that it is the first e-reading platform to be integrated with facebook ticker and timeline.

And in 2012, Kobo released its new generation tablet, **Kobo Arc**. To be honest, I think this is the most beautiful Android tablet (you know why I only say Andorid..) in my eye. And the Kobo Arc uses the same operation system with Kobo Vox. So this guide also suits for Kobo Arc.

It is no doubt that Amazon eBook Store's capacity is times larger than Kobo eBook Store, what if you are a Kobo user and want to buy an eBook, which can't be found in Kobo Store but was sold in Amazon? That would be a little awkward. Some experienced users must know that we can install Kindle app on Kobo as it is an Android based tablet. But I believe many eBook lovers like me have our own regular reading app and we have been used to use this app to read, to take note and clipping, and even to manage our ebooks collection. But I can assure you that only Kindle app can read Amazon Kindle books.

So is there a way to **read Kindle books on Kobo tablet / e-ink reader freely**? Follow this article you can get the answer.

### Method 1\. Part A: Remove Kindle RM (.azw/.kfx)

![Kindle Drm Removal](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-kindle-to-read-on-kobo.png "Kindle DRM Removal")

**Notice**: To get a 100% successful decryption result, the best way is to install a [Kindle for PC](http://download.epubor.com/sold/KindleForPC-installer-1.24.51068.exe) / [Mac](http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/mac/download) on your computer, then download the books to your local drive through the Kindle program.

### Method 1\. Part B: Convert AZW to ePub for best viewing on Kobo Vox

Calibre is a freeware which can convert ebook formats. 

Step 1: Download and install Calibre to convert the azw to ePub / PDF which is accepted by Kobo tablet and e-ink readers. [![Calibre download](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_load_button.png)](http://calibre-ebook.com/download)

### Method 2: Install Kindle android app on Kobo Vox

Kobo Vox uses a custom Android 2.3 system, so you can not simply install an Android app on Kobo Vox.

Please make some settings at first as the video shows:

After setting your Kobo Vox to receive the apps from unknown resource, then you can search for a Kindle for Android app then install it.

If you cannot access to the Google Play in Kobo Vox, please search "**Kindle app for Android apk**", and you can get plenty of results offering you the apk file downloading.

Kobo Vox doesn't support PDF for the moment. Only ePub & TXT.   
 You can use our \[url=http://www.epubor.com/ebook-converter.html\]ebook-converter\[url\] to convert PDF to ePub then read it on Kobo Vox.

Install Epubor DRM Removal on your Computer, and if you are a Kindle eBook reader, you must have installed Kindle for PC on you Computer.

 Run Epubor DRM Removal, it will find your Kindle eBooks in computer, click "unDRM Directory" then the books will be un-DRM.

 Use Calibre to convert unDRM Kindle to ePub, then read them on your Kobo Vox

 A kepub is just an epub with a lot of extra code, "kobo spans", that the Kobo uses. It's extension is ".kepub.epub".

Why do you need to convert epub to kepub? First, KEPUB books support Kobo’s fast flip function. Second, KEPUB books support Kobo’s expanded reading statistics pop-up. Third, KEPUB provides access to Kobo’s built-in image viewer, which lets you zoom the images embedded within the book. If you need to make full use of these new features provided by KEPUB, you can try the following methods to convert epub to kepub. 

### How can we convert EPUB to Kepub

For converting EPUB to Kepub without limitation, we'd better make sure the EPUB files are DRM free. Here you can use the eBook DRM Removal tool -- [**Epubor Ultimate**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/drm-removal-tools/) to decrypt DRMed EPUB files, then start converting EPUB to Kepub. It's a powerful DRM decryption program, compare with other similar software, its friendly and clean interface make it easier to use. Besides, conversion speed is also super fast.

Download the tool for free:

The detailed steps on removing epub DRM with Epubor Ultimate, please read:

* [How to remove DRM from EPUB books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

After we have got the DRM free EPUB files, how can we convert EPUB to Kepub? Which eBook converter should we use? Here I recommend you a free but powerful eBook management tool [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), but we should know the fact that itself doesn't support Kepub formats. To convert EPUB to Kepub, we need to install a plugin--KoboTouchExtended to enhance it. This plugin enables some additional features to the Kobo Touch, Glo, Mini, Aura HD, and Aura. When transferring EPUB books to Kobo device, it will automatically convert EPUB to Kepub. Now just follow the steps below to start conversion.

Please ensure you have download and install [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) already.

Step 1Get the plugin

Click "Preference" on the menu bar, a window below will pop up, then tap "Plugins" under "Advanced".

Next, you will see a following dialogue, simply click "Get new plugins" button on the bottom left corner to find the KoboTouchExtended plugin.

As there are so many plugins listed, we can enter "kobo" in the search box behind "Filter by name", then we will find the KoboTouchExtended plugin easily. Simply select this plugin, hit "Install" button to install it. You may see an alert about the security risk, ignore it and click "Yes".

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step 2Convert epub to Kepub Calibre

* Connect your Kobo eReader to computer with USB.
* Add EPUB files you need to convert to Kepub to Calibre.
* Select EPUB files you want to send to device and click "Send to device" button.

![send epub to kobo](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/send-epub-to-kobo.png)

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006928/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

When the transfer has been finished, you can see the job status turns to "zero", open your KoboeReader drive, in the root folder, you will find there are several new created folders which are named as author's name. Open it, you can see your transferred EPUB files have become .kepub.epub format.

Eject your Kobo, wait for a while, then you can see your newly transferred files. 

By the way, there is another plugin which can also convert EPUB to Kepub, it's **KePub Output**. After you installed it, when you convert EPUB files, you can see Kepub in the list of output formats.

Worked excellent! To not have the chapter info on books that wasn’t imported from kobo has disturbed me for a while. Thank you for this help to make the reading experience on my kobo a bit better ?

When using option 2 (kepub output) my kobo cannot recognize the kepub format. Also no epub reader (i.e. digital editions) will read them either.

 When using option one (send to device and convert while sending). I get the .kepub.epub ending on the file and they work great (both the kobo and epub devices can read it) but it changes the wording on the titles on many of the books (i.e. if title was "Magicians 01: The Magicians" it becomes "Magicians, The").

Thank you for asking. If the devices is not well detected, please download kOBO BOOKS via Kobo destop application and then use the tool to remove the drm.

The Calibre option is not working on my Kobo Clara HD. The KoboTouchExtended plugin is installed and enabled. The files transfered to my device are just the standard epub files. Any suggestions?

 I had the same issue with you. So i tried to install "KePub Output" and it works!

if I use epubor ultimate to strip drm from my store items will it only strip drm and I will have the files in kepub format but without drm or will they be epubs without drm and I will have to then convert back to kepub?

Thank you for asking. Epubor can remove drm from kobo books. The file you get is the DRM epub. If you want DRM-free kepub, you can convert it back to kepub.

Plugin works perfectly with English language but has problems with Spanish. Seems to happen when there are accents. an example: nación becomes naci ó n, and Pérsico becomes P é rsico.  
 Please any help?

Books downloaded from the Amazon Kindle Store come in .azw format. This format was developed by Amazon from the open source .mobi format. The two formats are basically the same except that Amazon added digital rights management (DRM) to the .azw files. As an Amazon-owned format, azw is not that open compared to the industry standard ePub format, which leads to that many reading devices and apps can't read your azw books. So here comes the demand to convert Kindle AZW to ePub, PDF or TXT, but how to convert azw books to epub, pdf or txt books for reading on Sony e-reader and other devices?  
  
Now let us focus on AZW to ePUB, converting Kindle **AZW to ePUB.** To solve this problem, you need to follow the steps by using Calibre.

1\. Download and install Kindle for PC/Mac app on your computer.

 2\. Register the Kindle app on your computer with your Amazon ID. Double-click each item to download the Kindle books to your computer.

 3.For windows, go to ...\\(My) Documents\\My Kindle Content\\... to get the Kindle books.  
 For Mac, check "Kindle" --- "Preferences" to get the Kindle content path.

 Note that Kindle content files are AZW.

The items were already downloaded. The problem is that I can't get to the directory of my kindle content other than through Windows. When I click on the kindle directory in Windows, there's nothing there.

I tried to convert an AZW that I know was purchased, not rented. Epubor said it couldn't convert the file because it was rented.

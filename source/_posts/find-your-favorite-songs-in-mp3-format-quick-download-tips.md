[Free trial?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/14/2019 3:27:54 AM 

I was looking to test the epubor product by converting an .aax file to mp3\. It only converted 10 minutes, which is understandable under a free trial basis. However, I need to know how it will parse a 10 hour audio book .aax. Will it break it up into 10 minute segments? Will it break it up into chapters as audible does? What??

[sample rate adjustment](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 12/22/2019 9:21:14 PM 

Hello, after converting AAX files to mp3 using "Epubor Audible Converter" v.1.0.10.214 on a Windows 10 PC the sample rate in the output files is constantly 64kbit/s rather than the original 128kbit/s in the AAX file. How can I adjust "Epubor" to not downsample the original 128kbit/s?  
 Thanks in advance for your help

[Cannot convert audiobooks reliably](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/25/2020 10:32:25 PM 

The first time I converted audiobooks following your steps and using your software, every book worked fine through chapter 1, but Chapter 2 on were blank. There were variably sized files, but they were blank. The second time I converted, every book was blank and wouldn't even play. I am trying to use MP4 and separate files for each chapter. I'm now trying MP3, which I think is vastly worse, which does not make me happy.

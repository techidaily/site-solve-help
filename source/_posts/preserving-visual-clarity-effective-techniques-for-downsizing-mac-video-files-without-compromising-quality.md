As videos are developing toward 4K, 5K and even 8K, we are facing with growing chanllenges of video size explosion. 

* A minute of 4K video @60fps recoded by iPhone X: 200MB in HEVC and 400MB in H.264;
* A minute of 4K video @60fps shot by GoPro Hero6 Black: 600MB in HEVC;
* A minute of 1080P video @25fps exported from Premiere Pro CC: about 1.65GB in Apple Prores422;
* A minute of a RED 4K FF(6:1) video @24fps: 1.1GB; a minute of Phantom Flex 4K Raw video @24fps: 25GB.

The sizes of modern videos are way too big. You will see them too big to get uploaded to social, transferred to mobiles, sent via emails, etc. Why? Because there are size limits on your favorite services. On FaceBook, only 4GB is allowed. WhatsApp allows pitiful 16MB. The limits of other email services range from 20MB to 10 GB... In most cases, we need to reduce the video size. But how? Learn ways to compress video file size on Mac by up to 97% without losing perceptible quality loss.

##  How can You Make Videos Smaller on Mac 

### Method 1: Remove Unnecessary Parts

**1\. Split long videos:** most direct way to reduce video size on Mac without quality loss - make your video shorter. You can cut a long video into small pieces. You can also remove the ads, advertising break, the beginning or ending of the video. 

**2\. Remove unwanted parts:** the video recorded may contain black bars or scenes that are not necessary. Deleting those parts will also make the video size smaller to a certain extent. In other words, you will need a tool that is capable to cut and crop, so that you can freely remove the blank or black space from the video scenes. 

### Method 2: Reduce Video File to Smaller Formats

Different video formats may vary distinctly in size and each format may excel others in special application. You can shrink video file size on Mac based on your needs. (if you don't want to bother, the H.264 or H.265 will be your best choice.)

**1\. Compress video for Email**: the maximum size for most email services like Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo, AOL is around 25Mb, that's about a few minutes only. To [reduce video to smallest size for email](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), WMV is a popular choice, which will provide relatively small size and good quality.

**2\. Downsize video files for Android/iOS**: all the mobiles come with limited storage, and a 4K UHD movie can occupy most space. To decrease high space video to low space video for Android, iPhone iPad, H.264 MP4 will be the most suitable format. For newer devices, H.265 HEVC is suggested as it's half the size of H.264.

**3\. Reduce video size for YouTube/Whatsapp/web**: each video-sharing site imposes different limits on the sizes and formats. First, if H.265 is supported, then go for it. Besides, FLV, AVI, WMV, MP4 are the most commonly used formats on web, and H.264 is the best recommend. To [shrink video for YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), Whatsapp, Facebook, and others, select MP4 or FLV.

### Method 3: Adjust Settings to Reduce Video File Size

**Video size = bit rate \* length**. Beyond this equation, video size involves various video audio parameters. You can adjust those video settings to reduce video file size on Mac.

**1\. Bit rate**. Bit rate is the number of pits that are processed in a given amount of time. Bit rate will directly affect the size. Higher bit rate means larger file size and better video quality, and lower bit rate refers to smaller file size but less quality. Lowering bit rates is an efficient way to shrink video size on Mac. To ensure good output quality, it's safe to lower the bit rate to one level below the original setting.

**2\. Resolution**. Resolution refers to the number of pixels in an image, for example, SD 720 X 480, HD 1,920 X 1,080, 4k UHD 4096 x 2160 and 8K FUHD 7680 X 4320 pixels. The higher the resolution is, the larger the file size will be. To reduce the file size of 4k movies downloaded, or 4K clips recorded by cameras, you may need a [video resolution converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

**3\. Frame rate**. The higher number of frames will bring smoother motion effect. Therefore, video in 60fps will result in higher video quality compared to 24fps. But the more frames will significantly increase the file size.

**4\. Sampling rate**. Sampling rate is the number of samples of audio carried per second. The higher quality requires more samples. Simply put, the higher sampling rate will result in higher audio quality as well as the larger file size.

### Best recommended video compression settings 

Memory size, processing speed, colour palette all affect the video file size. For those who have trouble figuring out the most suitable settings to shrink/reduce video file size without losing quality, here we also suggest the best video settings for you.

## How to Copy DVDs on Mac to an External Hard Drive to Watch on TV?

If you're copying the DVD movies to a hard drive on Mac for later playback on TVs, you'd better copy the DVD to a format support by your TV. You may choose to rip the DVD to MP4, which is supported by most TVs, or check the user manual of your TV model. After you rip the DVD to an external hard drive on Mac/Windows, you can play the movies from the hard drive on the TV. To play movies from a hard drive on a TV, there are two methods.

### 1\. Stream DVD Movies on Hard drive to TV from Plex 

Once all the DVDs are ripped on an external hard drive, you can set up your Plex. Download Plex and set it up. Login/create your account and name the server. Then create a library and add your movies. If your streaming player works with the Plex app, you can access your movie library and watch the DVD movies on the TV. Note that Plex doesn't support DVD formats such as ISO image and Video\_TS folder. 

### 2\. Connect the Hard Drive to the TV

Check the manual of your TV to see if it supports HDD or USB input. If yes, simply connect the external hard drive to the TV and you can watch the movies on it. But you need to make sure that: the converted DVD movie on the hard drive is in a codec supported by the TV.

In addition, you need to ensure that the format of the hard drive is supported by your TV. Most TVs use the NTFS standard (However, macOS only supports FAT32 and exFAT formats). If the external hard drive you use to save the DVD copy is in HFS+ format, you need to format it to the NTFS format.

## FAQ about DVD to Hard Drive

**1\. Can I directly copy the VOB, IFO, and BUP files from DVDs to the Mac hard drive?**

Yes, as long as the DVDs are not encrypted or protected. If the DVD is properly made by yourself without copy protections, you can open the DVD and find a folder called Video\_TS. In the folder, there are multiple files like VIDEO\_TS.BUP, VIDEO\_TS.IFO, Video\_TS.VOB, VTS\_01.\_0.BUP, VTS\_01.\_0.IFO… The actual video is stored in.VOB files. You can either copy the entire Video\_TS folder from the DVD to your Mac hard drive or external hard drive, and play the Video\_TS folder with the Apple DVD Player app, or copy the .VOB files from the DVD to your Mac hard drive to play the individual VOB videos. 

But for protected DVDs, you can't simply copy the content because the DVD copyright protections are designed to prevent DVDs from being copied directly.

It all depends on what you want to do with the copied DVD video. Below are some examples:

* If you want to transfer the DVD collections to a hard drive to keep a safe copy, then quality will be what you care about most.

* If you want to copy DVDs to a hard drive on Mac in order to play them easily without using an optical drive any more, MP4 is good for you. It's widely supported by most mobiles, TVs, players, and devices.

Then you can store about 200 DVD movies on a 1TB hard drive. However, if you choose to copy the DVD on a Mac hard drive in a more efficient format, such as MP4, the size of the copied DVD will be largely reduced. Then you can transfer more DVD movies on the hard drive.

4. At the top of the MakeMKV window, choose where you want to save the copied Blu-ray content on your Mac. Make sure you have enough free space on your hard drive for the output file.
5. Click on the "Make MKV" button to start the copying process. MakeMKV will extract the selected content from the Blu-ray disc and save it as an MKV file on your computer.

However, if you're copying a dual-layer DVD (with a capacity of 8.5 GB) or a DVD with additional content like special features, the copying process may take longer. 

**8\. Is it legal to copy DVD to hard drives on Mac/PC?**

We advocate for transferring a DVD to your computer's hard drive under the concept of Fair Use and do not encourage any illegal reproduction or distribution of copyrighted content.

## Can I Copy My DVD to the Mac's Hard Drive Directly? 

Yes, if the DVD doesn't contain DRM or other copy protection measures, you can copy the DVD content to hard drives on Mac/PCs by drag and drop. 

**Step 1.** Insert the DVD into the optical drive of your Mac. Double-click the DVD drive on your Mac to open it. 

**Step 2\.** Find and copy the VIDEO\_TS folder or ISO image file of the DVD. Then paste the DVD contents to the Mac's hard drive or an external hard drive. You can also do it by holding ALT and dragging the DVD from the Mac to your hard drive. 

**Step 3\.** Now open the VIDEO\_TS folder and you will see some BUP, IFO, and VOB files. Copy and store the VOB files to your hard drive, as they contain the DVD movie. However, VOB files are not supported by QuickTime or other Mac applications. You can try tools like VLC, 5KPlayer, etc. to open them. 

However, in most cases, when you try to play the VOB files in a DVD Video\_TS folder, you may find the file is empty or can't play normally. Or even worse, you can't copy the DVD content to the hard drive of your Mac at all. This is because that the DVD is copy-protected and the encryptions on the DVD will prohibit you from copy the DVD video directly. So how to transfer a protected DVD to hard drive on Mac?

Now let's show you how to copy DVDs to a hard drive with Disk Utility on Macs. First, make sure the hard drive on your Mac has at least 4GB, as Disk Utility can only copy DVD to Mac's hard drive in ISO Image, which is quite large in size. 

**Step 1.** Insert the target DVD into your Mac's built-in DVD-ROM drive or an external one.

**Step 2.** Launch Disk Utility. Where is Disk Utility? Open a Finder window, click on Applications in the left window, scroll down, and click on the Utilities folder. Then you'll find Disk Utility. 

**Step 3.** The name of your DVD drive will appear in the left panel of Disk Utility. Click on it.

Then click Save. Now Disk Utility will start creating an image file from your DVD. Once done, you'll see a confirmation message. The resulting image file will end with .CDR file extension.

## How to Copy DVDs to Mac Hard Drive with VLC? 

VLC is a popular free media player. It contains the capability to copy videos from DVDs to Mac's hard drive. You can choose to copy DVDs to Mac hard drive in MP4, MOV, MKV, TS, WebM, OGG, FLV, WMV, and several more. If you're on a tight budget and don't require advanced ripping options, VLC can serve as a decent solution for basic DVD ripping needs.

However, VLC is not as efficient or feature-rich as other programs. It takes longer time to copy a DVD to the hard drive on Mac. This can be a significant downside for users who need to transfer multiple DVDs to Mac hard drive. You can't use it to copy any protected DVD to hard drives. Overall, if you frequently rip DVDs or require more advanced functionality, it's advisable to consider dedicated DVD ripping software.

**Pros:** 

* VLC is free and open-source.
* It's easy to use VLC to copy DVDs to Mac hard drive.
* It can help copy DVD to hard drive in several formats.

**Cons:** 

* VLC can't copy protected DVDs.
* VLC takes too long to copy a DVD.
* VLC is not as user-friendly or intuitive as dedicated DVD ripping software.

### Summary

To copy a DVD to a hard drive on a Mac, all the above options have the job done. In terms of the better way, it depends on your specific needs and preferences. Disk Utility is a free and simple option but lacks advanced features. Handbrake and MakeMKV are free options with more customization options but may require some technical knowledge. VLC is a versatile media player that can also rip DVDs, but it may not be as user-friendly or versatile compared to dedicated software. Overall, MacX DVD Ripper offers a more user-friendly experience with advanced features. It also shows better performance in copying protected DVDs to hard drive, output quality, and copying speed.

## How to Copy DVDs on Mac to an External Hard Drive to Watch on TV?

If you're copying the DVD movies to a hard drive on Mac for later playback on TVs, you'd better copy the DVD to a format support by your TV. You may choose to rip the DVD to MP4, which is supported by most TVs, or check the user manual of your TV model. After you rip the DVD to an external hard drive on Mac/Windows, you can play the movies from the hard drive on the TV. To play movies from a hard drive on a TV, there are two methods.

### 2\. Connect the Hard Drive to the TV

Check the manual of your TV to see if it supports HDD or USB input. If yes, simply connect the external hard drive to the TV and you can watch the movies on it. But you need to make sure that: the converted DVD movie on the hard drive is in a codec supported by the TV.

In addition, you need to ensure that the format of the hard drive is supported by your TV. Most TVs use the NTFS standard (However, macOS only supports FAT32 and exFAT formats). If the external hard drive you use to save the DVD copy is in HFS+ format, you need to format it to the NTFS format.

## FAQ about DVD to Hard Drive

**1\. Can I directly copy the VOB, IFO, and BUP files from DVDs to the Mac hard drive?**

Yes, as long as the DVDs are not encrypted or protected. If the DVD is properly made by yourself without copy protections, you can open the DVD and find a folder called Video\_TS. In the folder, there are multiple files like VIDEO\_TS.BUP, VIDEO\_TS.IFO, Video\_TS.VOB, VTS\_01.\_0.BUP, VTS\_01.\_0.IFOâ€¦ The actual video is stored in.VOB files. You can either copy the entire Video\_TS folder from the DVD to your Mac hard drive or external hard drive, and play the Video\_TS folder with the Apple DVD Player app, or copy the .VOB files from the DVD to your Mac hard drive to play the individual VOB videos. 

But for protected DVDs, you can't simply copy the content because the DVD copyright protections are designed to prevent DVDs from being copied directly. 

**2\. Any other tools to copy DVD to Mac hard drive?** 

* VLC - free rip unprotected DVDs on Mac hard drive in MKV, MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV, and various other formats.
* iSuper DVD Ripper - rip home-made DVD to hard drive on Mac in MP4, AVI, WMV, etc. It doesn't support protected discs.
* MacTheRipper - MTR V2.6.6 is a free choice to save DVDs in VIDEO\_TS folder on Mac hard drive. Macrovision and CSS protections are supported.
* Mac DVDRipper Pro - Copy DVDs to Mac hard drive in ISO image or dvdmedia, and also rip DVDs to .m4v/.mp4/.mkv for iDevices and Apple TV. The first 5 rips are free.

**3\. How to copy DVDs from Mac to an external hard drive?**

If you need to transfer DVDs to an external hard drive on Mac, you'd better [convert DVD to digital](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) video, save it on your local Mac's hard drive, then transfer the DVD video from Mac to an external hard drive. It's always not a good idea to set an external hard drive as the destination folder during ripping. 

Here is how to do it: Connect the external hard drive to your Mac > open the Finder app and select the DVD video > press Command-N to open a second Finder window and choose the external hard drive under the Devices >drag and drop DVD video from your Mac's Finder into the external hard drive. 

**4\. What is the best format to rip DVDs onto a hard drive?** 

It all depends on what you want to do with the copied DVD video. Below are some examples:

* If you want to transfer the DVD collections to a hard drive to keep a safe copy, then quality will be what you care about most. In this case, consider ISO image, Video\_TS folder, MPEG-2 VOB files, or MKV. They will keep 100% of the original DVD quality, but these formats are not accepted by many players.
* If you want to copy DVDs to a hard drive on Mac in order to play them easily without using an optical drive any more, MP4 is good for you. It's widely supported by most mobiles, TVs, players, and devices.
* If the hard drive doesn't offer a very large storage for your DVD collection, try to convert the DVDs to MP4 HEVC. It's able to compress a DVD from 7.5 GB to less than 1 GB without quality loss.

**5\. How many DVDs can you store on 1tb hard drive?**

It depends on what format you use to copy the DVD. For example, if you copy the DVD to a hard drive in ISO image or Video\_TS folder in order to keep the best quality, the copied DVD video will be as large as the source DVD, namely, 4.7GB. Then you can store about 200 DVD movies on a 1TB hard drive. However, if you choose to copy the DVD on a Mac hard drive in a more efficient format, such as MP4, the size of the copied DVD will be largely reduced. Then you can transfer more DVD movies on the hard drive.

**6\. How do I copy a Blu-ray DVD to my Mac hard drive?**

To rip a Blu-ray DVD to a hard drive, you will need a program to decrypt and copy the Blu-ray discs. For that, it's highly recommended to use MakeMKV, which supports encrypted Blu-ray DVDs. Here are the steps: 

1. Visit the official MakeMKV website and download the appropriate version for your Mac. Then insert the Blu-ray DVD you want to copy into your optical drive.
2. Open MakeMKV on your Mac and it should be able to load the Blu-ray disc automatically. If not, click on the "File" menu and select "Open Disc." MakeMKV will detect the Blu-ray disc in your drive and display its contents.
3. MakeMKV will display a list of titles and chapters found on the Blu-ray disc. Select the main movie or the specific content you want to copy. Uncheck any unwanted titles or chapters.
4. At the top of the MakeMKV window, choose where you want to save the copied Blu-ray content on your Mac. Make sure you have enough free space on your hard drive for the output file.
5. Click on the "Make MKV" button to start the copying process. MakeMKV will extract the selected content from the Blu-ray disc and save it as an MKV file on your computer.
6. Once the copying process is finished, you will have an MKV file with the same content as the original Blu-ray DVD on your Mac's hard drive.

**7\. How long does it take to copy a DVD to hard drive on MacBook Pro/Air, iMac, Mac mini?**

The time it takes to copy a DVD to a hard drive on Mac can vary depending on several factors, including the speed of your Mac's DVD drive, the size of the DVD, the performance of your Mac, and the DVD copy software or method you use.

On average, copying a standard DVD (with a capacity of 4.7 GB) using typical DVD copying software can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. However, if you're copying a dual-layer DVD (with a capacity of 8.5 GB) or a DVD with additional content like special features, the copying process may take longer. 

**8\. Is it legal to copy DVD to hard drives on Mac/PC?**

It is widely considered legal to copy your legally purchased DVD to a hard drive for backup or easier playback purposes. However, it is important to note that this practice should only be done for personal use and not for illegal distribution of copyrighted content. We advocate for transferring a DVD to your computer's hard drive under the concept of Fair Use and do not encourage any illegal reproduction or distribution of copyrighted content. It is important to abide by the local DVD copyright laws before engaging in such activities.

As a standard eBook format, EPUB is widely used on various reading software and eReader, such as iBooks, Google books, Kobo and Nook devices, etc. But unfortunately, Amazon doesn't support EPUB files. If you are a Kindle user, it will be a little complex for you to read downloaded EPUB books on Kindle devices or app. You may have tried to directly transfer EPUB files to your Kindle, but the result is it didn't recognise EPUB books at all. In fact, things will be easier if we have an EPUB to Kindle Converter software.

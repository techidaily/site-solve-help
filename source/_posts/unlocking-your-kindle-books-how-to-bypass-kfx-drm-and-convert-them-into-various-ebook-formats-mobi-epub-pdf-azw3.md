### The necessity of converting Kindle KFX to MOBI

MOBI is the format used by the MobiPocket Reader and Amazon Kindle Readers. Technically speaking, a MOBI file is a binary database file that is built from its HTML source. MOBI formats are suited for smaller screens because of the image size limitation of 64K. Mobi files are used for storing digital books and are designed specifically for mobile devices with low bandwidth. MOBI can also display reflowable content and fixed width layout.

Nowadays most books delivered by Amazon Kindle are in KFX format which is supported by newer Kindle devices running newer firmware. However, many users still possess older Kindle devices which don't support the new KFX format. They don’t want to discard their old but working Kindle devices, so they need to convert the KFX format to MOBI, in order to make it compatible with their older Kindle eInk readers. Fortunately, we still have the option to convert KFX to KF7, a MOBI Kindle file that's optimized to be read on the older Kindle devices including the oldest Kindle eInk readers.

The table below shows the Kindle eInk readers and reading apps that support KFX format:

| Kindle Devices                                                                                                                      | Windows                                          | Mac                                               | iOS                                                          | Android                                                         |

### Explanation of KFX content: files composed of a KFX eBook

A KFX file is not a sole eBook content file, instead, it contains the Amazon encrypted eBook content, DRM voucher, and metadata describing the book such as the author, title, categories, keywords, and the number of pages.

A complete KFX eBook downloaded via Kindle for PC/Mac higher than version 1.19 are made up of various files, see the screenshot below:

![KFX-Content-via-Kindle-for-PC](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/KFX-Content-via-Kindle-for-PC.png)

The files that make up a KFX eBook downloaded via Kindle eInk device differ from those comprised of a KFX book downloaded via Kindle for PC/Mac. Under Kindle/Documents, you’ll see a book title with .kfx extension and a folder named after the book title with .sdr extension:

As you can see that books in KFX format are usually composed of multiple KFX container files. The entire set of KFX files that make up the book is required for successful DRM removal and format conversion.

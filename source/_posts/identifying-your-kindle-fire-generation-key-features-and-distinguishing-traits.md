Whether you want to buy appropriate accessories or root Kindle Fire, you definitely need to know the device model or generation. But Kindle Fire tablets were published by Amazon yearly. You may be confused by so many Kindle Fire versions and their similar names. So a question jumped out. What generation is my Kindle Fire? Read the below methods. And you will know how to tell **Kindle Fire Generations** easily. If you want to identify your Kindle eReader models, please read [How to Tell Which Kindle I have](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)?

### Method 1: Check Kindle Fire Generations on Device

Yes, from your Kindle Fire device, you can easily check the Kindle Fire detailed information. I use a Kindle Fire HDX to write this tutorial. 

Follow the step-by-step guide to check Kindle Fire generations:

Unlock Kindle Fire. Slide down from the top of the Kindle Fire screen. Tap the "Settings" option.

![tap kindle fire settings](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/tap-kindle-fire-settings.png)

From the "Settings" menu, tap "Device Options" >> "Device Model". You will find the Kindle Fire generation.

### Method 2: Identify Kindle Fire Generations from List of Kindle Fire Models

From the below table, you can easily find out the Kindle Fire generations. Of course, it does not only include Kindle Fire generations but Kindle Fire serial number, release year and other specific information. You can synthesize that information to determine the Kindle Fire model. And you can also use it to compare Kindle Fire models and determine which one you want to buy.

If you don't know where you can find the Kindle Serial Number, you can read the full guide on [How to Easily Find the Kindle Serial Number](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Hi,  
 thanks for posting this useful information!

 Unfortunately, for someone with a dead kindle, it's not going to yield an answer :)

 The back of the Kindle Fire HD 8 is (unethically) difficult to read, and it's not clear if it actually has the model number.

 THe red box the Kindle Fire HD 8 comes in has a plethora of numbers , including 3 bar codes: UPC, DSN, and (unlabelled, sigh, Amazon, shame on you),  
 as well as a "lot code".

If you registered your Kindle to your Amazon account, log into your account, hover your mouse over Account & Lists, then click on Your Content & Devices. Near the top of the screen, click on Devices and then click on the button with the ellipse (3 dots) to the left of your Kindle Fire. The popup will list your device name, type, registration date and serial number.

I'm on my third Kindle fire HDX third generation. I feel it is the best. The problem is that the charging area breaks every time. Nearly impossible to fix. So each time I've had to buy a new one. Great until it breaks again and can't be charged. I've tried the 10\. It is way poorer quality then the HDX. Very sad

Hi, i was able to determine I have a 2012 second generation the serial number starts with D025, thank you. One question, on your first option you say to tap settings. Mine settings is under +more and your next step was to tap device options. I don't have a device options, just device which gives the s/n not the generation. So, do I still have the right generation based solely on the first 4 digits of the s/n?

I did change batteries using eBay generic batteries on third and fourth generation. Ones that come with tools. Was about $30 then. These batteries do not have the endurance of the originals. The inside is tight and delicate. OEM batteries you might as well buy anew Kindle.  
 The only advantage of older ones is they did not get the last update. It seems to me the new update is both clumsiness than what I am used to.and slower on older tablets it does install on.   
 On the other hand I have the latest HD8 and HD10 and am very happy with improvements except operating system. Not sure about gen 1 or 2 but I think some of my old ones would boot on power. Are you sure charger is good? Or cord. I wear out a lot of cords.  
 I go.to longer cords than need a better charger. Like the new USB C

Good information. I am trying to locate a new case for my wife's Kindle. Thanks to your research I now know it is a 2nd Generation Kindle Fire with a D026 prefix. What would be helpful would be listing the exterior dimensions of the different Kindle's. Amazon sells replacement cases but would a replacement case for a 1st Gen fit just as well for a 2nd Gen? And would a 2nd Gen HD case fit either the 1st Gen or 2nd Gen earlier model? Thanks again for the good work.

Trying to find new case/cover for my 7 inch kindle fire (2nd generation), but can't locate one. Amazon always shows Fire HD. Will a 7" tablet cover fit my 7" kindle fire?? 

 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 Thank you.

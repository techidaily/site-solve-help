### The Necessary to Install Antivirus Apps on Kindle Fire

Can you get a virus on your kindle fire? Generally, if you don't do some hidden dangerous actions include side load or install apps/browsers/extensions from unknown sources, jailbreak device, browse the distrustful web pages or open dubious attachments from email, your Kindle Fire will not be attacked by viruses or malware. But be practical and realistic, only use the official provided functions or APPs is far from meeting our needs. At least for me, sometimes I must install some third-party apps or do some changes for my Kindle Fire. Or when I surf the internet on Kindle Fire, there is a big possibility to open an unsafe web page. So there is necessary to install an antivirus app to give your Kindle Fire a complete security.

The Dr.Web Antivirus Light version is the basic protection from viruses and it is free. It is designed by Dr.Web LTD which is the anti-virus pioneer in Russia. It keeps updating the virus reservoir to protect your device. When you install new applications on Kindle Fire, it will automatically scan them. Quick scan, full scan, and custom scan are provided for you. The fewer files stored in the Kindle Fire, the shorter the scan time spent. When the malicious objects are detected, you will find them in the quarantine zone. You can also use it to scan specific files or folders and look over the statistics of detected threats and performed actions.

### 2\. Norton Kindle Tablet Security

![Norton anti Malware](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/norton-anti-malware.png)

This Norton anti-malware version is focused on Kindle Fire Tablet. It will automatically update the virus reservoir weekly to make sure you have the best protection. It will also automatically scan all downloaded files. You can also choose to scan SD card when you plug them into a device. The best thing is you can set your scheduled scan. Or you can scan now. It will detect viruses, malware, and other threats to protect your device.

### 3\. Avast Security & Antivirus

![Avast Security Antivirus](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/avast-antivirus-security.png)

Avast Security is important in security and antivirus filed for Kindle Fire. It can automatically scan the infected apps, Trojans, spyware and suspicious files. And it has more functions beyond scanning for viruses. You can use it to check the permissions of installed apps. Another feature is that it will give you a safe web browsing by blocking malware, infected pages or ads. In addition, you can lock sensitive apps which you want to keep private or safe. You can also check the security of your WI-Fi for vulnerabilities. And I think BOOST RAM is the best feature which can shut down all opened apps. Install Avast Security, you get more than an antivirus.

### 4\. AVG AntiVirus

![Avg Antivirus Free](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/avg-antivirus-free.png)

AVG AntiVirus can be used to protect your personal data from viruses, malware, spyware, and Trojans. Its features include app lock, device lock, battery, data and storage management, task killer, antivirus and safe web browsing. If any threats detected, Kindle Fire virus warning will alert you. Some features only can be used after you paid to upgrade. But the free version is enough to use. It not only to be used to lock installed apps but keep the privacy of your photos. Furthermore, you can use it to back up your apps.

AVG no longer provides protection on Kindle Fire devices. I contacted both Amazon and AVG. Amazon said I wasn't able to put AVG Pro on my recently updated 5th generation Fire 7 because AVG no longer supports those old devices and I needed to contact AVG support as to how to put AVG anti-virus and AVG Pro on my new Fire 8\. I had to submit a service request from AVG about my old and new Fire devices. Udaya Suresh from AVG stated in his reply: "I would like to inform that Amazon devices are no more supported for AVG Antivirus apps. We have officially removed the app from the store and if you could find, it is Amazon that is responsible for further support. ... Currently, Android is the only platform that is supported by us. If I can be helpful again, please don't hesitate to write back me. Thank you!"

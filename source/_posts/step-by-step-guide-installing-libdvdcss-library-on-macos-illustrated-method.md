In this post, we will guide you on how to easily download and install libdvdcss on Mac Sonoma, Ventura, High Sierra, El Capitan, and earlier versions, facilitating the ripping of protected DVDs.

### What is Libdvdcss for Mac? 

Libdvdcss is an essential component of the VideoLAN project and is utilized by VLC media player and other DVD software. It acts as a key, allowing DVD programs to effortlessly access and decrypt DVDs encrypted with CSS. This makes it a crucial library for certain free DVD ripper software, such as Handbrake, which lacks native DVD decryption capabilities. Therefore, if you intend to [rip CSS-protected DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or remove DVD region code using Handbrake on Mac, you need to download and install libdvdcss on Mac first.

## Part 1\. How to Download Libdvdcss on Mac using Homebrew 

To easily obtain libdvdcss on Mac for Handbrake, you can install VLC 0.9.x or later, as it includes libdvdcss. However, in certain situations, macOS might block Handbrake from accessing VLC's libdvdcss. In such cases, you'll need to manually download libdvdcss for Handbrake on macOS versions like Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, High Sierra, El Capitan, etc.

For Mac computers running macOS later than 10.10 El Capitan, users can streamline the installation process of command line software such as cask, htop, and open-source packages like libdvdcss on Mac using Homebrew. Before downloading libdvdcss on Mac for Handbrake, make sure to install Homebrew by executing a few Terminal commands. (Homebrew is compatible with both Intel and Apple Silicon chips M1/M2 Mac) 

* **Step 1**: Open the **Terminal** application and enter the following command into the terminal: _/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"_  
**Note:** If the above command doesn't work on Apple M1 and M2 Macs, you may also try the command: _/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"_. After the installation, you need to edit your _.zshrc_ file and add the following at the bottom:  
_export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH_  
 _export PATH=/opt/homebrew/sbin:$PATH_  
![Instal Homebrew to Download libdvdcss on Mac](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/homebrew-on-mac.jpg)  
**Step 2**: Hit **Return** \> enter password to begin the installation of Homebrew.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png" border="0">Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

**Step 3:** Once the Homebrew is installed, open Terminal and enter "**brew install libdvdcss**", then hit enter to download libdvdcss on Mac:  
![Download libdvdcss on Mac via Homebrew](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/arm-libdvdcss.jpg)  
**Step 4:** Homebrew will automatically download the libdvdcss file on Mac. Once the process is finished, you can use Handbrake to rip encrypted DVDs and open protected discs with your media player.  
**Note:** If you still get errors like "Copy-Protected sources are not supported." with Handbrake or other programs after you download the libdvdcss via Homebrew, check the location where the libdvdcss is stored on your Mac. On Apple silicon, Homebrew installs files into the /opt/homebrew/ folder. But on an older Intel Mac, Homebrew installs files into the /usr/local/ folder. However, HandBrake only seems to look for the libdvdcss in /usr/local/lib. Therefore, you need to check if Homebrew installs libdvdcss.2.dylib in /opt/homebrew/cellar/libdvdcss/1.4.3/lib. You need to copy it to **/usr/local/lib**.  
 If Handbrake still won't rip protected DVDs, see [how to fix Handbrake libdvdcss errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

## Part 2\. How to Download Libdvdcss on Mac without Homebrew 

For those who don't want to use Homebrew, there is a method to manually download libdvdcss on Mac. Here are the steps to manually download and install libdvdcss on Mac Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, High Sierra, El Capitan, etc.

**Step 1:** Open the link <https://download.videolan.org/pub/libdvdcss/> and there are all the libdvdcss versions. The latest libdvdcss for Mac is libdvdcss 1.4.2\. Select **1.4.2** from the list, then choose **macosx**. Click on the libdvdcss-1.4.2.pkg to download the libdvdcss for macOS.

_**Note:** You can also go to the VideoLan website and find libdvdcss. From the website of libdvdcss, you will see “libdvdcss is available through Git or by browsing the releases.” Click Releases to get the list of libdvdcss versions. Sites like Git and VideoHelp also offer libdvdcss for Mac download links._ 

![Download libdvdcss on Mac manually](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/libdvdcss-download.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2:** Once the libdvdcss-1.4.2.pkg is downloaded on your Mac, double-click on the pkg file and install the installer as per the prompts. The only thing to note is, the location of the libdvdcss on Mac is now placed in the folder **/usr/local/lib** than /usr/lib. 

**Note:** The above method to download libdvdcss on Mac may not work on Sonoma, Ventura and newer macOS as there is a security feature called System Integrity Protection. It may prevent you from installing libdvdcss on Mac directly. If you're not allowed to install libdvdcss on Mac manually, then you need the help of Homebrew.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Option 2:** You can also use the Terminal to download the libdvdcss on Mac. Open a Terminal and enter the following command line. You will need to enter a password for an account with administrative privileges when you run the command line for the first time. 

_cd /usr/local/lib_ 
 _sudo curl -O https://download.videolan.org/libdvdcss/1.4.2/macosx/libdvdcss.2.dylib_

If any error occurs, run the command: sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib. Once the libdvdcss is installed on Mac, completely restart Handbrake and it will automatically use the libdvdcss to rip a copy-protected DVD. 

**Option 3:** Some users are wondering if they can download libdvdcss on Mac via VLC. Yes. VLC has libdvdcss include to decode protected DVDs. If you have VLC installed on your Mac, the DVD player/ripper software is able to load the VLC libdvdcss automatically when handling a protected disc. However, sometimes there may be conflicts between the software and VLC, causing the libdvdcss library to be unusable.

## Download Libdvdcss on Mac M1/M2 Apple Silicons 

If you're downloading libdvdcss on an M1 M2 Mac from VideoLAN, you may get the error:

_macgui: dlopen error: dlopen(/usr/local/lib/libdvdcss.2.dylib, 0x0001): tried: '/usr/local/lib/libdvdcss.2.dylib' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'x86\_64', need 'arm64e')), '/usr/lib/libdvdcss.2.dylib' (no such file)_

You should note that an M1/M2 Mac requires the **Arm architecture-compatible version of libdvdcss**. So you can't download the libdvdcss to M1/2 Macs directly from VideoLan. But you can download libdvdcss on Mac via homebrew. After you download the libdvdcss on your Mac, try to compile the libdvdcss library from source like this:

Step 1\. Download official libdvdcss on your Mac from VideoLan website at https://get.videolan.org/libdvdcss/1.4.3/libdvdcss-1.4.3.tar.bz2  
 Step 2\. tar -xjf ./libdvdcss-1.4.3.tar.bz2  
 Step 3\. cd libdvdcss-1.4.3  
 Step 4\. ./configure --prefix=/usr/local  
 Step 5\. make  
 Step 6\. sudo make install 

## Libdvdcss won't work with Handbrake on Mac?

**Reason 1:** The **Gatekeeper may block the .dylib files** and therefore, Handbrake can't use the libdvdcss on Mac. Then you need to manually check and open the .dylib files for Handbrake. 

**Reason 2:** The libdvdcss file is installed in the **wrong location on your Mac.** The libdvdcss should not be saved on Mac in the folder /usr/lib as it's write-protected with SIP. Instead, you should download and install libdvdcss on Mac in /usr/local/lib. If there is only a /usr/lib folder on your Mac, you may create the directory and then sudo cp into the /usr/local/lib directory. Or use the Finder with shift-**⌘-**g and type in /usr/local/lib to open a window to copy the files. You can just create the directory:

_sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib_

Also, as mentioned earlier, on M1/M2 Macs, libdvdcss may be installed in the /opt/homebrew/ folder by Homebrew. 

**Reason 3:** If you have installed VLC on your Mac, the libdvdcss included in VLC may **go conflict with** the libdvdcss you've just downloaded on your Mac. If you are downloading libdvdcss on Mac for Handbrake, you can update your VLC to the latest version and check out if it works. If not, uninstall VLC and download libdvdcss on your Mac. 

**Reason 4:** Libdvdcss only supports decrypting DVD with CSS. If the libdvdcss is not decoding a specific protected DVD on Mac, it can be caused by an **advanced encryption** measure, such as 99 fake titles, bad sectors, structure protection, fake playlists, etc. In this case, you can rely on a profesionall DVD ripper to decode a protected DVD.

The latest libdvdcss for Mac is 1.4.2\. 

**4\. How can I use libdvdcss on Mac?**

As metioned above, libdvdcss is used to access DVDs encrypted with CSS. Many free DVD rippers and players can't deal with CSS protections alone. Libdvdcss can work with them to access the DVD data.

Once you open an app like Handbrake, it will automatically use libdvdcss installed on your Mac to read a protected DVD. 

**5\. How to check if libdvdcss is properly installed on Mac?**

When Handbrake still says "No Valid Source Found." even after you download libdvdcss on Mac, you may want to figure out if it's because of 1\. LIBDVDCSS is NOT installed properly OR 2\. because this is a kind of encryption that LIBDVDCSS can't deal with. You can find the Terminal application in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder. In the Terminal window, type the following command and press Enter: otool -L /usr/local/lib/libdvdcss.2.dylib.

Step 2\. Then copy and paste the libdvdcss-2.dll file into the Handbrake installation folder (usually C:\\Program Files\\HandBrake).

**7\. Is libdvdcss legal?**

There's never a straight answer about whether or not it is legal to use libdvdcss. In the case of libdvdcss+VLC or other players, it's usually legal as it won't violate any copyrights. If you use libdvdcss to break and rip a protected DVD, it's regarded as illegal under DMCA. That being said, libdvdcss hasn't been brought up in a court case then it must be okay to use.

[Is it okay to convert a file to ePub that doesn't say nodrm?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/18/2016 6:51:36 PM 

Hi, I'm using the trial version of your software. I've tried to convert a Kindle book I bought, but it's acted differently from the other one I just covered to ePub. When I put it into the list of files in the Ultimate window, it doesn't tick or say "decrypted". However, if I then convert it to ePub, it works. The files appear to both still contain the Kindle serial number. Will this cause me a problem with Kindle if I then view it on my reader on my Samsung phone?

 These are the filenames: bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.azw3 (after import), and bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.epub (after conversion  
).

I can't get Epubor KCR to work with Kindle Cloud Reader now. It looks like Amazon removed the ability to download kindle books. There is no button for downloads and nothing happens when I right-click the book cover in Kindle Cloud Reader. When I open a book, it doesn't download because epubor KCR doesn't see any books. Can this be made to work? Epubor KCR only works with Kindle Cloud Reader. I am using Chrome.

[Kobo Glo HD Start Up Loops back to Set up](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/31/2020 1:59:48 AM 

E-reader began to fail without notice by asking for wifi credentials then showing it was attempting to sync as part of set up through the e-reader was fully functional. It then displays a message "Something went wrong...please try again". It repeats this process each time we turn it on and treat the wifi login.   
 I have done the hard re-boot by inserting the pin. I connected it to my computer - it shows it linking and uploading the books and dictionaries. When complete, i try again but the process is still the same - start up process and the indefatigable message something went wrong. No resources on-line have proven to be of any assistance.

## Exploring the Intricacies of How-To Geek's Rigorous Product Testing and Review System

[How-To Geek’s product reviews and recommendations](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-transform-smartphone-capabilities-into-a-professional-yt-channel/) come from the same team of experts who have helped hundreds of millions of people fix their gadgets for the past 15+ years. Each has spent years assessing the latest technology trends and can fairly evaluate a device against the competition.

 Our team goes hands-on with every product we review, with most also spending time at How-To Geek’s testing lab and office in Virginia. We benchmark everything from the CPU in the latest Windows laptop to the battery life in the newest wireless earbuds. We also use the opportunity to capture pictures and videos in our in-house photo studio, allowing readers to see the device from every angle.

 Products only stay in our office briefly, though, as our reviewers take them out into the real world and use them just like you would. They write up their findings only after extensive testing in the reviewers’ homes and daily lives.

 When the review is complete, the unit is either returned to the company or PR agency that lent it to How-To Geek or stored in Valnet’s Virginia office for long-term testing. Having the device on hand allows our editorial teams to directly compare it to similar products and share additional content on various social media channels.

 If a company doesn’t want its product back after a given amount of time, How-To Geek donates it to a local charity.

 We do not allow companies to sponsor or offer compensation for reviews. Reviews are written independently, and brands have no say in the content of our reviews. We may earn a commission if you click an affiliate link and purchase a product, but our editorial team chooses all our product recommendations independently without considering affiliate relationships.

##  How We Score Reviews

 How-To Geek rates products on a 10-point scale. Reviews are always somewhat subjective, but the editorial team combines the writer’s experience and testing with benchmarks, pricing, and product comparisons to give each item a fair score.

 Here’s what our numerical review scores translate to:

1. Does Not Work
2. Barely Functional
3. Severely Lacking in Most Areas
4. Functions, but Has Numerous Issues
5. Fine, Yet Leave a Lot to Be Desired
6. Good Enough to Buy on Sale
7. Great and Worth Purchasing
8. Fantastic, Approaching Best-in-Class
9. Best-in-Class
10. Borderline Perfection

 In very rare cases, How-To Geek might adjust a review’s rating—positively or negatively—due to changes that take place after the review is published. We will always include an update note at the top of the review explaining that a change has been made and why we believe the score needs to be modified.

 How-To Geek awards its Editor’s Choice designation to products that are the best in their category.

The Editor's Choice recommendation is much more selective and is voted on by multiple editorial team members.

 Below are several products that received an Editor's Choice award:

* [Apple iPad Pro (M4)](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-tutorial-to-bypass-your-oneplus-ace-2v-face-lock-by-drfone-android/)

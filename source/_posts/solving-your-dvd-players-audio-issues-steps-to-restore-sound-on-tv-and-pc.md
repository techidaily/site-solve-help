## Part 1\. Causes and Solutions for No Sound from DVD Player on TV

### 1\. DVD player or DVD disc problems

* Check your DVD player. If the DVD player is cheap or very **old**, it's probably time to upgrade to a new one.
* Check to see if your DVD disc is in good physical condition and free of **scratches or damage**.
* Make sure the disc is inserted **correctly** into the DVD player.
* Figure out whether the DVD disc is homemade or commercial as they utilize different codecs. Make it clear what types of files your DVD player supports, and make sure your DVDs are in that format. For example, **region-locked DVDs** may cause DVD player no sound issues too.

 A free DVD ripper [**MacX DVD Ripper**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) can help fix no sound issues caused by unsupported DVD types and copy protections by 1:1 copying (protected) DVD to USB flash drive in MPEG-2, ISO image, VOB, MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, HEVC, H264, etc. at GPU hardware accelerated speed (up to 320kbps). Then you can play DVD on TV via USB drive, external hard drive, or streaming services (Plex media server) without using a DVD player.

### 2\. DVD player connection or cable issues

**2.1** A potential reason for the [DVD player no sound on TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) trouble is related to the connection, whether it is **proper and firm in place** or not.

**2.2** Make sure your cables are **in the right spot** on both. For the DVD player, the composite cable should be in order with yellow, white, and red. For HDTV, look at the back of the TV, where it should say "Video 1," "Video 2," or "Video 3," whichever one has the red, yellow, and white cables, and say "Video IN." Match the colors, then try. 

![DVD player no audio due to connection issue](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd-player-cable.jpg) 

**2.3** Some users have experienced the same problem: images but no sound on a DVD player via an HDMI cable. In such a case, you can check if your **HDMI sound is set to "On."** Some devices with HDMI output do some "automatic detection" to turn audio outputs on or off accordingly. If this still doesn't fix the DVD player no audio problem, you can consider throwing away the faulty HDMI cable and replacing it with a new one.

**2.4** Connect another audio source to the TV or stereo receiver or connect the DVD player to another audio input of the TV or stereo receiver to narrow down the culprit of the DVD player no sound errors.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**2.5** Try a different audio cable: If the audio cable you are using is damaged or faulty, it could be causing the no sound issue. Try using a different audio cable to see if that solves the DVD player no sound on TV error.

### 3\. DVD player settings problems

**3.1** Audio not working on a DVD player might result from incorrect menu settings. Check for volume and hit mute to adjust sound settings back to normal.

**3.2** Check if your DVD player **switch settings** are correct.

**3.3** Change the audio output on the DVD player from HDMI or Digital Audio Output to **PCM or LPCM**. Then the amplifier may start to play the sound. To change the settings, the steps may vary based on different manufacturers. For example, on Sony DVD players: go to Setup > Audio Settings > choose Digital Audio Output and select PCM.

![choose PCM or LPCM](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/lpcm.jpg)

**3.4** Try to turn OFF the **HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color option** on the HDMI 3 in the TV settings. This has fixed the no audio errors on many LG DVD players. 

**3.5** If you are playing an **MPEG-2 Program Stream** file on a DVD player and there is no sound, turn off your DVD player and then turn it on again. It may fix the Philips/LG/Sony DVD player audio playback issues with MPEG2 PS videos.

**3.6** Panasonic DVD players may not play **DTS audio sources**. In this case, you need to try another audio source, like Dolby Digital, or connect to an AV receiver and choose Bitstream in the Audio Out settings.

**3.7** Another possible cause of no sound coming from the DVD player is the selected audio track that the device might be powerless to handle. If so, try another audio track as a test.

### 1\. **DVD player software problems** 

\- Check the DVD player software **volume settings**, muted or not.

\- **Exit** your DVD player software and reboot it again.

\- If you're using VLC media player to play DVDs on the computer, you have a fair chance to encounter the VLC audio video out of sync problem or VLC no sound when playing a DVD. No choice but to resort to the best VLC alternative - 5KPlayer to play DVDs on PC without sound issues.

![VLC play DVD no sound](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/vlc-no-sound-dvd.jpg) 

\- If using the Windows Media Player, eject the disc and insert it again. If nothing good happens, reload the sound driver and see if that troubleshoots the problem. Follow these steps:

1. Open Device Manager.
2. Opt for "Sound, video and game controllers" and expand the same.
3. Highlight the driver, right-click and then choose "Uninstall".
4. Restart your laptop.
5. Install the latest audio drivers downloaded from the manufacturer's website.

\- If you've upgraded to macOS Ventura, you can use the built-in 64-bit DVD player app to play your DVD content, which may help you resolve no sound from DVD player issues. 

Providing the above solutions don't work, the best once-for-all solution is to play DVD movies with digital format rather than DVD disc.

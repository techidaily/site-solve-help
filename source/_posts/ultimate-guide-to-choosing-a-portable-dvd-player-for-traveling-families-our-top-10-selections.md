## 6 Factors to Be Considered before Buying a Car DVD Player

There are an overwhelming number of DVD players designed for use in the car. But good quality DVD player for your car is particularly hard to find, especially when you haven't gathered any information about it. Don't worry, we've collected mainly 6 things you need to take into consideration before buying a DVD player for your vehicle. 

### 1\. Types

There are 4 major types of DVD players, inclusive of flip-down DVD player, headrest models, in-dash DVD players, and rearview DVD players. Generally, the headrest model is placed respectively at the back of the front two seat headrests, offering good viewing for the passengers. This is highly recommended.

### 2\. Screen Size

Larger screen offers theater-like viewing experience. But for car DVD player, unreasonably large screen will cause visual burden. Feasibly, the screen of your DVD player shall be chosen in accordance with the amount of your space available in your car. So 10-11 inches is preferable. 

### 3\. Resolution 

Resolution plays a decisive role of your entertainment quality. The ideal resolution is no less than 1024 x 600 units, which will give crisper and more vivid image even if you drive at an average speed. 

### 4\. Supported Formats

A good media format compatibility is a trump card for most great car DVD players. These players can not only play DVD-RWs and DVD-Rs, but also play various audio formats, including MP4, MP3, CD-R, CD, and CD-RW. It will be a plus if people can play games or listen to their own music stored on USB drive or SD cards.

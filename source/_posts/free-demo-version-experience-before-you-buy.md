[Nook is not listed in left panel of Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 5/4/2019 2:44:54 AM 

Hi I'm using your trial version of Ultimate. A Nook option is not in the vendor list on the left panel. (Yes, I clicked the ellipses button, not there either).  
 I'm on a Windows 10 Desktop computer.   
 As you probably know, Nook for PC no longer works. So I've deleted the program, however the downloads directory (containing books) is still on the computer. Folder: D:\\Documents\\My Barnes & Noble   
 Most if not all of these book are key encrypted with the old B&N method of user name + credit card #.

[Is it okay to convert a file to ePub that doesn't say nodrm?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/18/2016 6:51:36 PM 

Hi, I'm using the trial version of your software. I've tried to convert a Kindle book I bought, but it's acted differently from the other one I just covered to ePub. When I put it into the list of files in the Ultimate window, it doesn't tick or say "decrypted". However, if I then convert it to ePub, it works. The files appear to both still contain the Kindle serial number. Will this cause me a problem with Kindle if I then view it on my reader on my Samsung phone?

 These are the filenames: bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.azw3 (after import), and bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.epub (after conversion  
).

Hi,

 I want to avail the free 30 day trail for Epubor before I buy the full version. However, upon installing the software, it is asking for a licence key for me to be able to try it. Where can I find that for a trial version?

 Thanks

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??

[Bulk import](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/15/2019 11:25:39 PM 

Hi all. Just installed the trial version as I have quite a large library.

 Is it possible to get Epubor to do a bulk import of files in a folder, rather than adding them one by one?

[What are limitation of the trial version?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/26/2021 12:19:30 AM 

I attempted to test a conversion of a Kindle eBook to PDF and of the 496 pages, only 25 pages converted and that did not include the cover. Are there limitations to the trial version? I really want to make sure this program is going to convert all pages before determine if it's worth purchasing.

[How do I get paragraph break in convert to text?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/1/2020 8:55:02 AM 

I just purchased an annual license.

 The full version is NOT treating text the same as the full version.

 In trial version, Converting KFX book to Text maintained the paragraph breaks. The Full aversion does not -- so the book is one huge single line.

 How do I get paragraph break in convert to text? 

 FYI, as a work around, I tried converting to PDF as a work around. However, PDF adds LINE breaks (specific to the printed page) as well as Paragraph marks. But it uses the SAME control code for each, so I can't just search and replace line marks and leave paragraph marks.

 I would appreciate your help and guidance to solve this .

 Thanks.

[Free trial - unable to test the product](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/7/2021 9:04:30 PM 

Hello, I'm really interested in epubor so I downloaded the software to test the product.  
 I followed each step of the guide, was able to remove the DRM and to open the decrypted ebook.  
 The txt file says that I can read 20 percent which is okay for a trial version. But unfortunately this is not true, because I can't even read 1 percent of the book, the txt file is pretty much empty and has a 1Ko size...  
 I tried with an other book, same result.  
 So in fact I can't try the product at all, and I really want to be able to try it because it seems like an amazing product !  
 Can you help me in this matter ?

Many people love comics. Even for adults, comics still have lots of appeal as it provides us so many imaginary worlds in which we can release our pressure of the daily life. Now with the development of big-screen handheld such as tablet, e-book reader and cellphone, we can enjoy comics in sofa or bed. Just stretch your body and relax your mind, immerse yourself in fantasy and imagination. I bet you will like this feeling. And this article is just about how to read comics on Kindle Fire. If you have a Kindle Fire, I'm sure the content below will do help you; If not, this article can also be a good reference of reading comics on handset. So just don't miss it! 

### 1\. Read comics purchased from Amazon store

This is the most common way of reading comics on Kindle Fire. You can buy and download comics in the built-in Amazon e-book store and then read them directly, all just like reading e-books. It must point out that the comic books in the Amazon store don't support resizing single page. This is a bit inconvenient as sometimes you need to zoom in a single page to read dialogues more clearly and see more details. Fortunately, in most comics we can tab each image on every single page to zoom in. But you can't resize it freely just like resizing images on iPhone with your two fingers. Second time you tap the image, it will reset to the original size.

In addition, the comic books in the Amazon store don't support landscape mode. But this seems not to be a problem as they are optimized for the Kindle Fire's screen size so it's good when reading comics in vertical mode.

### 2\. Read comics downloaded from internet

Perhaps the comics in Amazon store don't satisfy you. This may due to quantity, quality or reading mode. So you may come up with the idea that downloading comics on the internet and transferring them to your Kindle Fire. This sounds awesome as we can enjoy countless comic books! Considering most of the comics on the internet are CBZ and CBR formats which Kindle Fire doesn't recognize, you need to install a third party comic reading app. Here I choose the _**Perfect Viewer**_.

So let's get started!

#### **1\. Download comics from internet**

There are many websites for downloading comics. Just search any comics you like and download them on your PC. Here I recommend some websites for you:

<https://www.cbr.com/>

<https://getcomics.info/>

<https://comics-all.com/>

![read comics on kindle fire-Comic website](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/7-Comic website.jpg)

Comic website

#### **2\. Transfer the comics to your Kindle Fire**

Connect your Kindle Fire to PC with USB cable. It will be recognized as a removable disk. Then copy the comic you've downloaded and paste it in the Kindle Fire. I suggest you create a new folder called "Comics" (any name as you like) and put the comic in. It's convenient to manage.

#### **3\. Install Perfect Viewer and read your comics!**

You can search "perfect viewer" in the Amazon apps store (costs $2.99). Purchase the Perfect Viewer and open it in "Apps" on your Kindle Fire. The Perfect Viewer provides more functions and features than the native Kindle reader. You can set the options to suit yourself.

Hi, reese.  
 Many comics are black and white ones, especially the Japanese comics.

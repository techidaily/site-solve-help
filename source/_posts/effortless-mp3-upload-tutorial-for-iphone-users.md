### How to Transfer MP3 to iPhone with iTunes

iTunes is the only official tool to put files to iPhone. It is an audio and video player that lets you manage your iOS devices as well as download content from the iTunes store and use Apple Music. It's an all-in-one home for your music and video, although it's music where it really excels.

#### Method 1 — Transfer mp3 to iPhone manually.

The advantage of the method: You never lose your old songs from your iPhone, even if you don't have them in your iTunes Library. 

Step 1connect iPhone to your computer and launch iTunes, next click the iPhone icon.

![iphone icon1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/iphone-icon1.png)

Step 2click **Summary** in the left sidebar and scroll to the Options section and select **Manually manage music and videos**.

#### Method 2 — Add mp3 to iPhone automatically

The advantage of the method: you don't have to manually drag and add songs to iPhone. You just need to add songs to iTunes Library. Your iTunes Library and iPhone are always in sync. 

Step 1launch iTunes on your computer and select **File** \> **Add File to Library** on the menu bar to add mp3 files from your computer to iTunes library.

### Transfer mp3 to iPhone without iTunes

There are quite a few disadvantages with Apple's mobile products, and one that drives me crazy is their reliance upon iTunes for all your file syncing needs. If you want a song on your iPhone, you pretty much have to use iTunes to get it on there. Now, don't get me wrong, iTunes is a good way to organize your music library, but sometimes you just don't want to be locked down like that. So what are the alternatives? You'll probably be surprised, but there's actually more than one way to put file on your iPhone without using iTunes!

#### 1Transfer mp3 to iPhone with Airdrop

AirDrop is an ad-hoc service Apple Inc.'s macOS and iOS operating systems, which enables the transfer of files among supported Macintosh computers and iOS devices over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, without using mail or a mass storage device.

Step 1launch Control Center by swiping up from the bottom bezel of your iPhone, turn on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and then AirDrop.
